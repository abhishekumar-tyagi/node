# Node.js Support Guide

Node.js contributors have limited availability to address general support
questions. Please ensure you are using a
[currently supported version of Node.js][1].

When seeking support, please first search for your question in these venues:

- [Node.js Website][2], especially the [API docs][3]
- [Node.js Help][4]
- [Open or closed issues in the Node.js GitHub organization][5]

If you didn't find an answer in the resources above, try these unofficial
resources:

- [Questions tagged 'node.js' on Stack Overflow][6]
- [#node.js channel on libera.chat][7]
- [Node.js Slack Community][8] *(Register at [nodeslackers.com][9])*

GitHub issues are for tracking enhancements and bugs, not general support.

The open-source license grants you the freedom to use Node.js. It does not
guarantee commitments of other people's time. Please be respectful and manage
your expectations.

## Troubleshooting Steps

When encountering issues with Node.js, follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check Node.js Version**: Ensure you are using a currently-supported
version of Node.js. You can check the supported versions [at the release
schedule][1].

3. **Review Documentation**: Consult the official [Node.js documentation][2]
and the [API docs][3] for relevant information.

4. **Search for Solutions**: Utilize the search functionality on the [Node.js
website][2], [GitHub issues][5], [Stack Overflow][6], or other community
platforms to find solutions to your problem.

6. **Check for Updates**: Ensure your Node.js dependencies and packages are
up-to-date by running `npm update` or `npm outdated`. If you are still
experiencing an issue with a specific dependency, contact its maintainers
before seeking support from Node.js

7. **Review Error Messages**: Pay attention to error messages and logs to
identify the root cause of the issue.

8. **Isolate the Problem**: Reproduce the issue in a minimal environment
to isolate the problem. This helps in pinpointing the cause and finding a
solution.

9. **Debugging**: Use debugging tools such as Node.js built-in debugger, or
third-party tools like `node-inspect`, to debug your application.

10. **Community Forums**: If you're unable to resolve the issue on your own,
seek help from the Node.js community through forums, chat channels, or
Slack.

## How to Ask a Good Question

When asking for help with Node.js, follow these guidelines to increase the
chances of receiving helpful responses:

- **Look for Duplicates**: More often than not, someone else has had your issue
before, so it's extremely important to search for a solution before asking a
question.

- **Provide Context**: Clearly explain what you are trying to accomplish,
what you have attempted so far, and any relevant background information.

- **Include Code**: If applicable, include a minimal, complete, and verifiable
example of your code that reproduces the issue.

- **Error Messages**: Include any error messages or stack traces you've
encountered.

- **Versions**: Specify the versions of Node.js, npm, and any relevant
dependencies you use. If you are experiencing an issue with a specific
dependency, contact its maintainers before seeking support from Node.js

- **Be Polite**: Remember to be polite and respectful to those who are trying
to help you.

## What to Ask/Not to Ask

### Do Ask:

- Specific questions about Node.js features, APIs, or best practices.
- Questions about troubleshooting specific errors or issues.
